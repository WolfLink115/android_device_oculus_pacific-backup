# Unofficial TWRP device tree for Oculus Go (Pacific)

### Will upload image of device later lol

## What's working?
* So far almost everything.

## Not working?
* As far as I know, the only real issue is the Display being rotated to what seems like portrait mode.
* No OTA Update support yet
* You tell me :3

# Special thanks!!
* PizzaG for telling me that encryption wasn't working, helping me get the partitions mounted properly; A/B partitions showing up properly as well, and helping with init files
* Alijoshua for helping me start off the port in the beginning, and trying to help with A/B partitions as well.
* Everyone else who gave me help and support!
