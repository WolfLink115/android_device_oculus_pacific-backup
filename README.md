# Unofficial LineageOS device tree for Oculus Go (Pacific)
## NOTHING IS WORKING YET AS FAR AS I KN0W! SO FAR I AM ONLY TESTING AND BUILDING!
### That being said, this is mostly a learning project as well as something that can hopefully become a usuable port in the future.

## What's working?
* Unknown!

## Not working?
* Unknown!

# Special thanks!!
* PizzaG for helping me get TWRP working.
* Alijoshua for helping me start off the port in the beginning, and trying to help with A/B partitions as well.
* Rajatgupta for help with the TWRP device tree and this Android device tree.
* Everyone else who gave me help and support!
